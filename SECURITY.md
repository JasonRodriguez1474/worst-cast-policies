- Use fictional company names and scenarios
- Review generated policies before sharing with students
- Remind students this is for educational purposes only

### For Students
- Do not submit actual company confidential information
- Use this tool only for coursework and learning
- Generated policies are examples, not legal documents
- Always consult with IT professionals for real-world implementations

## Scope

This security policy covers:
- The web application and its functionality
- Client-side security considerations


## Educational Use Disclaimer

This tool is designed for educational purposes and intentionally generates flawed cybersecurity policies to help students develop auditing and critical evaluation skills. 
The AI model used is specifically chosen for its tendency to produce mistakes, hallucinations, and gaps that mirror real-world policy review scenarios. 
Generated policies should never be used in production environments and are meant to be critically analyzed and improved upon as learning exercises.
